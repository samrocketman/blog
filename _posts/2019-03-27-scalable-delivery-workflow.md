> See my updated post [Git Low Effort Workflow](http://sam.gleske.net/blog/engineering/2019/11/12/git-low-effort-workflow.html) (GLEW for short).

This blog post is a response to a reddit user but reddit limited me to a 10,000
character response.  As a compromise I decided to say everything I wanted to say
and link back from [this reddit thread][reddit].  The following is a quote of
myself and this blog post is an elaboration on my reply.

(i.e. even the same SHA256 hash artifact).  Expanding on this.  I recommend that
your final release pipeline be from a Git tag.

A simple example is a Java library.  Your library is released to a hosting
provider like [Sonatype Nexus][nexus].  By releasing from a tag you publish the
binary only once and ship that binary through different environments of the
testing process (dev, qa, stage, prod).  It is important to note that what lands
in production is what was tested.   I recommend the full testing process be
performed on the Git tag (even duplicating the fast running tests run on a pull
request).

The same statement should apply to any "artifact" even if that "artifact" is a
[Docker image][docker] or a whole machine (like an [AMI in Amazon AWS][ami] if
you practice immutable infrastructure).

I'd like to explain the workflow I've developed to help relay exactly what I
mean by this.

# Before you read on

While some of the diagrams I'll share show Jenkins.  I'd like you to focus on
the workflow itself since it is tool agnostic and is generally a decent workflow
I developed to be in a CI as code system where CI code is stored in the repo of
the code being built (like Travis CI, CircleCI, Jervis: Jenkins as a service,
Jenkins multibranch pipelines, Jenkins X, etc <insert your favorite CI as code
tool>).

# Git workflow in a picture

It's easy to forget (or overlook) that tags, like branches, are just references
to commits.  A tag can diverge from a branch just like a branch can diverge from
a branch.  With that in mind here's a diagram showing a flow.

Generically, I call my method `GitHub flow with releases`.  I'll explain later
why I think this is different.

The thing I'd like to point out in the above diagram is that there are three
separate events.

1. Developer opens a pull request (or merge request) and adds commits to it.
   This is one pipeline.
2. A pull request is merged which triggers another event in a CI system.  On the
   branch, there's a script which should automatically bump the version (but not
   push to master).  The bumped version diverges from master and pushes the tag
   back to the SCM host.
3. When a tag is pushed another event is triggered for the pipeline.

# CI pipelines in a picture

Here's a second diagram I created.  It is color coordinated similar to the
"GitHub flow with releases" diagram.  The following diagram illustrates a
different dimension of the three events.

1. The first vertical column is viewed from top to bottom and illustrates a
   testing pipeline on a pull request.
2. The middle column is a pipeline read from top to bottom for when a branch is
   pushed (in this case `master`).  The branch pipeline also auto-version bumps
   and pushes the tag back (but does not push the version bump back to master)
3. The third column is a pipeline read from top to bottom and illustrates a
   production release pipeline.

> with releases` diagram.

# What makes this different?

What do I mean by, "I developed it"?  Most interpretations I've read about tag
releases involve pushing back to the master branch or tagging directly from the
master branch.  Throughout my career implementing workflows in mega-sized
companies I've found many limitations to this.  Automated releases can be really
hard.  Often, some of the tips I mentioned (such as Git tags diverging from
branches) are things I came to realize by myself and have not ever seen it
mentioned in actual articles which discuss Git in the context of automated
releases or team workflows.

I also want to explain why I feel it's different than similar "tag release"
methods.

1. First, there's no race condition between an automated release process pushing
   back to the `master` branch and developers trying to merge changes.  Every
   merge implies a release and every release diverges from master instead of
   pushing back to it.  This means multiple releases can happen in parallel and
   do not conflict with each other.  Developers can release practically as fast
   as they can merge code.
2. Hotfixes work well with the same diagram.  In my original diagram, let's say
   `0.1.1` is in production and needs to be hotfixed but `0.1.2` is the latest
   development release.  I would cut a short-lived `0.1.1-hotfix` branch which
   then has similar release automation as `master` but instead releases hotfix
   releases like `0.1.1.1`, `0.1.1.2`, etc for each merge into the short lived
   hotfix branch.  It is up to the developers to ensure that their hotfixes to
   the `0.1.1` series of releases make it back into `master` for general
   development and ensure the bug is not re-introduced in the future through
   automated tests.
3. This is a sane single-branch workflow which encourages many small releases
   (every PR merged is a tag release cut).  However, due to thorough testing not
   every release will necessarily reach production.  This is basically GitHub
   flow except that every merge commit initiates a tagged commit diverging from
   it.  Every tagged commit is a version bump based on other commits released.

# Real world example

If you've read this far I imagine you're interested to learn more.  I've created
a real world example project which is a Jervis CI project (a side project of
mine where I support Travis CI YAML in Jenkins but not relevant for this
discussion).  I'll explain the parts that matter.

[GitHub project example
`samrocketman/demo-jenkins-world-2018-groovy-jar`][example-project].

The CI as code files are in `.jervis.yml` and the `.ci/` folder.  The
`.jervis.yml` file eventually launches [the
`.ci/Jenkinsfile`][example-jenkinsfile].

Inside of the `Jenkinsfile` you'll see two sections of code:

1. `Create a Tag` (happens only on the master branch; not pull requests and not
   tags)
2. `Release to GitHub` (only happens on a tag)

This is a really simple example so the "Tag release" phase does't have much
because it's not a real product.

But this is basically where all of the production pipeline would occur.

1. Run fast unit tests (runs from PR)
2. Run longer running integration tests against non-shared services (may or may
   not be done in a PR but definitely in a tag pipeline)
3. Deploy to dev (deploy to dev can also happen from pull requests but should
   also happen in the production tag release pipeline)
4. Deploy to QA.  There might be a manual approval gate or if you're confident
   in your automated QA then proceed normally.
5. Deploy to stage.  Run automated smoke tests on stage.  The smoke tests runs
   some real world API calls on the service to make sure it is working
   correctly.
6. Production roll-out (which varies depending on your architecture).
   Personally, I like [twitter murder][twitter-murder] but I've not ever seen it
   run anywhere than twitter.  Now a days a production rollout is some form of
   lazy rollout with automatic rollback.  This is typically handled by another
   tool designed for it such as [Netflix Spinnaker][spinnaker].

There's a lot of things I purposefully left out above because I could talk all
day about this and I feel like I've written too much already.

# Summary

The important thing to note here (to re-iterate my first sentence) is you really
want to deploy the things you actually tested (binary-wise).  Your prod pipeline
should be running everything your test pipelines ran and then some if you want
it to be fully automated.

Let's remember the real problem being solved.  Increase your confidence to
deliver your product on a regular basis.  This workflow enables that and by
keeping changes small you reduce the risk of change.
